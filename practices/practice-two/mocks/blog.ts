      subtitle: 'Why Responsible AI (RAI) is important?',
      content:
        "Gen AI provides a powerful tool for building software; however, companies confront adoption challenges due to concerns about AI safety and responsibility — in surveys, enterprises' main roadblocks are privacy laws (31%), AI governance, and orchestration (31%); and more than 50% of enterprises emphasized the risk of biases and hallucination.

      content:
        'There are various RAI use cases across the AI stack, and these solutions can be divided into two dimensions: AI engineering workflow and the “value” of responsible AI, and grouped under three jobs-to-be-done (JTBD): 1) Assess and improve AI quality, 2) Make AI secured and privacy-preserving, and 3) Prepare responsible data.',

      content:
        'Gen AI shifts from LLM to LMM can meaningfully benefit many industries such as medical, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, commerce, robotics, etc. This means that responsible AI needs to be more sophisticated as the level of complexity increases.',
